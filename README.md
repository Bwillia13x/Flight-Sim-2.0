- Control surface effectiveness based on airspeed
- Realistic stall behavior and recovery
- Physics-accurate thrust and drag modeling

### EnemyAI
Advanced AI system featuring:
- **Patrol State**: Waypoint navigation with configurable routes
- **Pursuit State**: Intercept calculations and target tracking
- **Combat State**: Attack runs with weapon firing
- **Evasion State**: Defensive maneuvers and escape tactics

### WeaponSystem
Comprehensive weapons platform supporting:
- Projectile-based weapons with realistic ballistics
- Hitscan weapons for instant-hit mechanics
- Ammo management with reload timing
- Recoil forces affecting aircraft flight

## 🎨 Customization

### Aircraft Configuration
```csharp
[SerializeField] private float wingArea = 25f;          // Wing surface area
